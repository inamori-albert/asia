## Story
Being the professional drummer, I built and opened my website with my Ubuntu barebone computer so that I can introduce myself and the drum school to target Japanese customers.

Suddenly one day, an idea flashed into my mind, which was "you should do what you are good regardless of your personal history".

Do I like it? Do I want to do it? No.

You are going to where you can be of help.

OK.
