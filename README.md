# About
## Overview
My name is Toru.

The pronunciation is to + o + ru, but foreigner friends of mine pronounce it by to + ru, and it's all right.

I am a 40 y/o Japanese fat man living in Tokyo at this point ( in 2019/Feb ).

Drummer + translator + business analyst ( of IT ) + cook + Giant Escape rider

### Story
Being the professional drummer, I built and opened my website with an Ubuntu barebone computer.

Suddenly one day, an idea flashed into my mind, which was "you should do what you are good regardless of your personal history".

Do I like it? Do I want to do it? No.

You are going to where you can be of help.

OK.
